## Project Overview

This project is a demonstration version of a potential WebGL-based interactive training tool, designed to showcase how technicians could be trained to properly remove and replace components on an ASIC cryptocurrency miner.

In its current demo state, the tool focuses on the removal of a single cooling fan and highlights the corresponding step in a step-by-step PDF guide embedded alongside the interactive 3D content. The demo is intended to present the concept to stakeholders and demonstrate how such a tool could be expanded into a complete training system.
